### DATABASE DESIGN

The apartment rental web service will use Google Cloud SQL with PostgreSQL as the primary database. The database schema is designed to support the core functionalities of the application:

```mermaid
erDiagram
    Users ||--o{ Filters : creates
    Users ||--o{ Subscriptions : has
    Filters ||--o{ ZipCodes : includes
    Filters ||--o{ Criteria : has
    ApartmentListings ||--o{ ZipCodes : located_in
    ApartmentListings {
        uuid id PK
        timestamp listing_date
        float rent
        float broker_fee
        float square_footage
        int bedrooms
        int bathrooms
        date available_date
        string street_address
        string zillow_url
        timestamp created_at
        timestamp updated_at
    }
    Users {
        uuid id PK
        string email UK
        string password_hash
        timestamp created_at
        timestamp last_login
    }
    Filters {
        uuid id PK
        uuid user_id FK
        string name
        timestamp created_at
        timestamp updated_at
    }
    ZipCodes {
        string zip_code PK
    }
    Criteria {
        uuid id PK
        uuid filter_id FK
        string field
        string operator
        string value
    }
    Subscriptions {
        uuid id PK
        uuid user_id FK
        timestamp start_date
        timestamp end_date
        string status
    }
```

Key considerations for the database design:

1. Use of UUIDs as primary keys for better distribution and scalability
2. Indexing on frequently queried fields (e.g., zip_code, rent, bedrooms)
3. Timestamp fields for tracking creation and updates
4. Separate tables for filters and criteria to allow for flexible filtering options
5. Many-to-many relationship between Filters and ZipCodes to support multiple zip code selection

### API DESIGN

The apartment rental web service will use a RESTful API design for communication between the frontend and backend, as well as for integrating with external services. The API will be implemented using FastAPI in Python.

1. Authentication Endpoints:

```
POST /api/auth/register
POST /api/auth/login
POST /api/auth/refresh
POST /api/auth/logout
```

2. User Management Endpoints:

```
GET /api/users/me
PUT /api/users/me
DELETE /api/users/me
```

3. Filter Management Endpoints:

```
GET /api/filters
POST /api/filters
GET /api/filters/{filter_id}
PUT /api/filters/{filter_id}
DELETE /api/filters/{filter_id}
```

4. Apartment Listing Endpoints:

```
GET /api/listings
GET /api/listings/{listing_id}
```

5. Subscription Management Endpoints:

```
GET /api/subscriptions
POST /api/subscriptions
GET /api/subscriptions/{subscription_id}
PUT /api/subscriptions/{subscription_id}
DELETE /api/subscriptions/{subscription_id}
```

6. Payment Integration Endpoint:

```
POST /api/payments/process
```

API Design Considerations:

1. Use of HTTPS for all communications
2. JWT-based authentication for securing endpoints
3. Versioning (e.g., /api/v1/) to allow for future API changes
4. Consistent error handling and response formats
5. Rate limiting to prevent abuse
6. Pagination for listing results
7. CORS configuration for security

### USER INTERFACE DESIGN

The user interface will be built using React with TypeScript and styled using Tailwind CSS. The design will focus on simplicity, usability, and responsiveness across devices.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Image Gallery] --> B[Key Details]
    B --> C[Description]
    C --> D[Map View]
    D --> E[Contact/Apply Button]
```

UI Design Considerations:

1. Responsive design using Tailwind CSS breakpoints
2. Accessible color scheme and contrast ratios
3. Intuitive navigation with clear call-to-action buttons
4. Skeleton loading states for improved perceived performance
5. Error handling and user feedback messages
6. Modular component design for reusability
7. Dark mode support using Tailwind CSS

The user interface will be implemented using functional React components with hooks for state management. TypeScript will be used to ensure type safety and improve developer productivity. Tailwind CSS utility classes will be leveraged for consistent styling and rapid development.

This system design outlines the key technical decisions and structures for the apartment rental web service, focusing on modern, scalable technologies that align with the project requirements and the Google Cloud ecosystem.

## SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

### AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORIZATION

The apartment rental web service will implement a robust authentication and authorization system to ensure secure access to user accounts and protected resources.

#### Authentication

1. JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
   - The system will use JWTs for stateless authentication.
   - JWTs will be issued upon successful login and included in subsequent API requests.
   - Token expiration will be set to 1 hour to minimize the risk of token theft.

2. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
   - Optional MFA will be available for users who want enhanced account security.
   - MFA will be implemented using Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP).

3. Password Policy
   - Minimum password length: 12 characters
   - Required complexity: At least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character
   - Password hashing: bcrypt with a work factor of 12

4. Account Lockout
   - Accounts will be temporarily locked after 5 failed login attempts within a 15-minute window.
   - Lockout duration: 30 minutes

#### Authorization

1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
   - The system will implement RBAC with the following roles:
     - User: Standard user with access to their own data and listings
     - Admin: Full access to system features and user management
     - Support: Limited access to user data for customer support purposes

2. Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)
   - ABAC will be used in conjunction with RBAC to provide fine-grained access control.
   - Attributes such as subscription status and user location will be considered for access decisions.

3. API Authorization
   - All API endpoints will require a valid JWT for access.
   - The backend will validate the JWT and check the user's role and attributes for each request.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Frontend
    participant AuthService
    participant API
    participant Database

    User->>Frontend: Enter credentials
    Frontend->>AuthService: Login request
    AuthService->>Database: Verify credentials
    Database-->>AuthService: Credentials valid
    AuthService->>Frontend: Issue JWT
    Frontend->>API: Request with JWT
    API->>API: Validate JWT
    API->>API: Check user role and attributes
    API-->>Frontend: Authorized response
    Frontend-->>User: Display protected content
```

### DATA SECURITY

The apartment rental web service will implement multiple layers of data security to protect sensitive user information and maintain data integrity.

1. Encryption at Rest
   - All data stored in Google Cloud SQL will be encrypted using Google-managed encryption keys.
   - Sensitive data fields (e.g., user passwords) will be hashed using bcrypt before storage.

2. Encryption in Transit
   - All communication between the client and server will use TLS 1.3 or higher.
   - Internal communication between services will also be encrypted using TLS.

3. Data Masking
   - Personal Identifiable Information (PII) will be masked in non-production environments.
   - Logging and error reporting will exclude sensitive data.

4. Data Access Controls
   - Database access will be restricted to specific IP ranges and use strong authentication.
   - Principle of least privilege will be applied to all service accounts and IAM roles.

5. Data Backup and Recovery
   - Regular automated backups of the database will be performed.
   - Backups will be encrypted and stored in a separate Google Cloud Storage bucket.
   - A disaster recovery plan will be implemented with defined RPO and RTO.

6. Secure Data Deletion
   - User data will be securely deleted upon account closure, using industry-standard data wiping techniques.
   - Retention policies will be implemented to automatically remove unnecessary data.

| Data Type | Encryption at Rest | Encryption in Transit | Access Control | Backup Frequency |
|-----------|--------------------|-----------------------|----------------|------------------|
| User Credentials | Bcrypt hashing | TLS 1.3 | IAM + IP whitelist | Daily |
| Personal Information | AES-256 | TLS 1.3 | RBAC + ABAC | Daily |
| Apartment Listings | AES-256 | TLS 1.3 | RBAC | Daily |
| Payment Information | Tokenization (PayPal) | TLS 1.3 | PCI DSS Compliance | N/A (not stored) |
