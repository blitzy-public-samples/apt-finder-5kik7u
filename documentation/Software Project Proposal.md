### BUDGET CONSIDERATIONS

Several factors could potentially impact the budget, and we have identified strategies to manage these risks:

1. Zillow API Integration Complexity
   - Risk: Unforeseen complexities in integrating with Zillow's API could increase development time.
   - Mitigation: We have allocated additional hours in the labor costs and included a contingency fund to account for potential challenges.

2. Scalability Requirements
   - Risk: As the user base grows, infrastructure costs may increase more rapidly than anticipated.
   - Mitigation: We have chosen a cloud hosting solution that allows for flexible scaling. We will monitor usage closely and adjust the infrastructure budget if needed.

3. Regulatory Compliance
   - Risk: Changes in data protection laws or Zillow's terms of service may require additional development or legal review.
   - Mitigation: We have included a budget for legal and compliance review and will stay informed about any regulatory changes that may affect the project.

4. PayPal Integration Challenges
   - Risk: Implementing PayPal's subscription model may be more complex than anticipated.
   - Mitigation: We have allocated sufficient development hours for this task and will consult with PayPal's developer support if needed.

5. Scope Creep
   - Risk: Client requests for additional features may impact the budget and timeline.
   - Mitigation: We have clearly defined the project scope and will use a change request process for any additions, with associated cost estimates.

6. Exchange Rate Fluctuations
   - Risk: If any project components involve international transactions, exchange rate changes could affect costs.
   - Mitigation: We will use forward contracts or set aside a small buffer in the contingency fund to account for potential currency fluctuations.

7. Third-Party Service Price Changes
   - Risk: Increases in the cost of third-party services (e.g., Zillow API, cloud hosting) could impact ongoing operational costs.
   - Mitigation: We will review all service agreements for potential price change clauses and factor these into our long-term budget projections.

By carefully managing these budget considerations and maintaining open communication with the client, we aim to deliver the project within the estimated budget while allowing for flexibility to address unforeseen challenges.
